# XGBoost Classification (Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes)

XGBoost Classification Project Overview:

This project provides a practical demonstration of using XGBoost classifiers to predict cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, which contains all the necessary code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. 
The notebook performs the following key steps for each dataset:

    Data Loading: The cardio_train.csv and diabetes.csv files are loaded into pandas DataFrames.

    Data Preprocessing: The data is prepared for model training, which may include handling missing values, scaling features, or encoding categorical variables.

    Model Training: An XGBoost Classifier is trained on each dataset separately.

    Evaluation: The performance of each trained model is evaluated using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
